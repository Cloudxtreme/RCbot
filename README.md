RCbot is an implementation of pircbotx, focused on modularity. Written in java, it is designed to be used in a variety of different chatrooms in IRC.

MISSION:

Create a java based IRC bot that anyone can use, even without java knowledge, that can run on any number of servers/channels, and allow the user to enable/disable plugins. Furthermore, have the ability for beginer/intermediate java users to be able to download, modify, and compile rcbot for their own use according to GPL v3.

GOALS:

- Create a configuration file for users to be able to edit, and then be able to create a bot from those settings.
- Create encapuslated plugins.
- Create additional plugins, and integrate existing libraries to provide functionality.
 

SUPPORT:

Currently, this project is still in major testing phase, but if you'd like help, feel free to contact andrew@recursivechaos.com
