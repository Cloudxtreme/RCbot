RCbot
=====

RCbot is an implementation of pircbotx, focused on modularity. Written in java, it is designed to be used in a variety of different chatrooms in IRC.

GOAL:

Create a java based IRC bot that anyone can use, even without java knowledge, that can run on any number of servers/channels, and allow the user to enable/disable plugins. Furthermore, have the ability for beginer/intermediate java users to be able to download, modify, and compile rcbot for their own use according to GPL v3.

TODO:

- Create a configuration file for users to be able to edit, and then be able to create a bot from those settings.
- Convert existing plugins to be used in a generic fasion.
- Convert plugins developed for different bots to be used with RCbot
